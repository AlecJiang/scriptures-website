  <h1>Scripture 1 – John 3:16</h1>

  <p class="reference">John 3:16</p>
  <p>
    “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
    whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
  </p>

  <h2>What This Scripture Teaches about Christ</h2>
  <p>
    This verse is one of the most famous descriptions of Heavenly Father's
    love and the mission of Jesus Christ. It teaches that the reason Christ
    came into the world was because of love—love for the whole world and for
    each individual person. The gift of the “only begotten Son” shows that the
    Atonement was not an accident or a backup plan. It was a loving, deliberate
    choice made for our salvation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The scripture also emphasizes belief. Eternal life is promised to
    “whosoever believeth in him.” True belief in Christ is not just agreeing
    that He exists; it means trusting Him, relying on His grace, and trying to
    follow Him day by day. Because of Christ, we do not have to be stuck in
    our sins or our past mistakes. Through Him, we are offered forgiveness and
    a new life with God.
  </p>

  <h2>How I Can Apply This Verse</h2>
  <p>
    When I feel discouraged or unworthy, this scripture reminds me that God
    already showed how much He loves me by sending His Son. I do not have to
    earn His love; it is already given. What I can do is respond to that love
    by believing in Christ, repenting, and trying again. Remembering this
    verse helps me be more patient with myself and more forgiving of others,
    because God loved “the world,” not just a few select people.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my daily life, I can apply this scripture by choosing to trust Christ
    in specific situations—like school stress, family problems, or personal
    weaknesses. Instead of thinking only about my own strength, I can look to
    Him and remember that His purpose is to give me everlasting life, not to
    let me fail.
