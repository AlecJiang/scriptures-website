  <h1>Scripture 5 – Philippians 4:13</h1>

  <p class="reference">Philippians 4:13</p>
  <p>
    “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.”
  </p>

  <h2>What This Scripture Teaches about Christ</h2>
  <p>
    Paul wrote these words while he was facing difficult circumstances, yet he
    still expressed complete confidence in Christ. This verse does not mean
    that we will suddenly be able to do anything we want; instead, it means
    that whatever the Lord asks us to do, He will give us the strength to
    accomplish it. Christ is the source of real spiritual power.
  </p>
  <p>
    The focus of the verse is not on “I can do all things” but on “through
    Christ.” On our own we are limited, but with His help we can endure trials,
    keep the commandments, and serve others in ways that would be impossible
    by ourselves. Christ strengthens us from the inside out—changing our
    desires, our thoughts, and our courage.
  </p>

  <h2>How I Can Apply This Verse</h2>
  <p>
    When I face something that feels too hard for me—like speaking in front of
    a group, moving to a new place, learning a difficult subject, or resisting
    temptation—I can remember this promise. Instead of telling myself “I
    can’t,” I can pray and say, “Through Christ, I can try again.” This verse
    helps me replace fear with faith.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can also apply it by giving Christ credit for my successes. When things
    go well, I can remember that the strength came from Him and thank Him in
    my prayers. Recognizing His hand in my life increases my gratitude and
    keeps me humble.
