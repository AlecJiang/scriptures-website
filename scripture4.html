  <h1>Scripture 4 – Isaiah 53:4–5</h1>

  <p class="reference">Isaiah 53:4–5</p>
  <p>
    “Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did
    esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for
    our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of
    our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.”
  </p>

  <h2>What This Scripture Teaches about Christ</h2>
  <p>
    Isaiah saw, many years before Christ was born, what the Savior would
    suffer for us. These verses describe the Atonement in very personal
    language: Christ bore <em>our</em> griefs and carried <em>our</em> sorrows.
    He was wounded and bruised not for His own sins, but for ours. The phrase
    “with his stripes we are healed” suggests that the very wounds He received
    are the source of our spiritual and emotional healing.
  </p>
  <p>
    This prophecy shows that Christ is not only aware of our sins but also of
    our pains, disappointments, and heartaches. He understands what it feels
    like to be rejected, misunderstood, and hurt. Because He has already
    carried these things, He can comfort us perfectly and offer us peace that
    we cannot find anywhere else.
  </p>

  <h2>How I Can Apply This Verse</h2>
  <p>
    When I feel guilty, ashamed, or broken, I can remember that Christ has
    already paid the price so that I can repent and be forgiven. I do not have
    to stay stuck in my past. I can choose to turn to Him, confess my sins,
    and accept His mercy. “The chastisement of our peace was upon him” means
    that He suffered so that I could have peace instead of constant fear.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can also apply this verse by trusting that Christ understands my pain.
    When I am sad or lonely, I can picture Him carrying those sorrows and
    walking beside me. Knowing that He has felt what I feel helps me not to
    give up and to keep moving forward with faith.
