    A small project website where I collect scriptures that testify of the Savior.

  <h2>About This Project</h2>
  <p>
    This website is part of my personal project for studying the scriptures.
    I chose several passages that teach me who Jesus Christ is, what He has
    done for me, and how I can come unto Him. By building this website, I spent
    more time reading, thinking, and writing about the Savior instead of just
    scrolling through the verses quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each page focuses on one scripture. I first share the verse, then explain
    what it teaches about Christ, and finally write how I can apply it in my
    everyday life. In this way, the project becomes more than just a technical
    website assignment—it becomes a way for me to bear testimony of Jesus
    Christ and record my personal thoughts.

  <h2>What I Hope to Learn</h2>
  <p>
    As I continue to study, I hope to notice new details in these verses:
    words that describe Christ’s character, promises that He gives, and
    invitations He extends. I also hope that anyone who visits this website
    can feel a little more of His love and be reminded to look to Him for
    strength and peace.
