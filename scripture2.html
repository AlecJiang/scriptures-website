  <h1>Scripture 2 – John 14:6</h1>

  <p class="reference">John 14:6</p>
  <p>
    “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man
    cometh unto the Father, but by me.”
  </p>

  <h2>What This Scripture Teaches about Christ</h2>
  <p>
    In this verse, the Savior does not just point to a way or give directions;
    He says that <em>He Himself</em> is the way. The path back to the Father is
    not a list of rules that we follow on our own. It is a relationship with
    a living, loving Redeemer. Christ is also “the truth,” meaning that in a
    world full of confusion and changing opinions, He is completely honest,
    steady, and trustworthy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Calling Himself “the life” reminds me that every good and lasting thing
    is connected to Him. Through His Resurrection, He conquered physical and
    spiritual death. Because of Him, our lives can have real purpose and hope,
    even when we do not understand everything that is happening.
  </p>

  <h2>How I Can Apply This Verse</h2>
  <p>
    When I make decisions—about school, friends, or my future—I can ask,
    “Does this choice bring me closer to Christ, the way?” Instead of only
    asking what is easiest or most popular, I can ask what helps me follow
    Him better. I can also study His words more carefully, because if He is
    the truth, then His teachings will help me see myself and others more
    clearly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Practically, this means praying in His name, reading the scriptures with
    real intent, going to church with a desire to worship, and trying to love
    people the way He did. Each small step of following Him is a step on the
    path that leads back to the Father.
