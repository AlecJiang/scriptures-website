  <h1>Scripture 3 – Matthew 11:28–30</h1>

  <p class="reference">Matthew 11:28–30</p>
  <p>
    “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
    rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in
    heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my
    burden is light.”
  </p>

  <h2>What This Scripture Teaches about Christ</h2>
  <p>
    These verses show Christ as a gentle and compassionate teacher. He sees
    the people who are “heavy laden” and invites them to come to Him, not to
    a program or a system, but to a person who understands their struggles.
    The image of a “yoke” suggests working side by side with Him. He does not
    remove all burdens instantly, but He carries them with us so that they
    become light enough to bear.
  </p>
  <p>
    Christ also describes Himself as “meek and lowly in heart.” Even though He
    is the Son of God, He is humble and approachable. This teaches me that God
    is not distant or harsh. Through Christ, the Father reaches out to us in
    kindness and invites us to find rest “unto [our] souls,” a deep peace that
    goes beyond just feeling relaxed for a moment.
  </p>

  <h2>How I Can Apply This Verse</h2>
  <p>
    When I feel overwhelmed by homework, responsibilities, expectations, or
    my own mistakes, I can remember that Christ specifically invites people
    like that to come to Him. I can come to Him through honest prayer, by
    telling Him exactly how I feel, and by asking for strength and guidance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Taking His yoke upon me also means learning of Him—studying His life,
    copying His patience, and trying to serve others the way He did. When I
    focus on Him instead of only on my problems, I often notice that the
    weight on my mind and heart becomes lighter, even if the situation itself
    has not changed yet.
